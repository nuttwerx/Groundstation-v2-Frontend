# React Groundstation

A React.js / Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) and websockets with [Socket.io](socket.io).

This is the main codebase authored by the [Sftw](https://rloop.slack.com/messages/eng-sftw/) team. It presents a web interface at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) that an operator can use to monitor and control the rPod.

## Code Standards

* We are using the [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) rules for our client/server JS code. <sup>[slack](https://rloop.slack.com/archives/eng-sftw/p1482007809001209)</sup>
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is used for reporting on code that is not properly styled.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rLoopTeam/react-groundstation.git # or clone your own fork
cd react-groundstation
npm install
npm run start-all

# alternatively you can run the batch files
installStartup.bat #(for installing npm packages and run app)
buildAndRun.bat #(for simply build and run)
debug.bat #(for running app and attaching a debugger)
startup.bat #(for running app)
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
